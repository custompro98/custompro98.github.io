Hi there. I haven't written a blog post in a while, really since I was a part of the [Weirich Institute hosted by 8th Light](https://weirichinstitute.com/). Those posts were waaaaay back when I was still pretty new to software engineering (I still had the title of "Junior Software Engineer" ðŸ˜±). These days, I'm a "Senior Software Engineer" (yay, I made it!). Take the early posts for what they are. For better or worse those were my actual thoughts. I left them as written to hopefully become a juxtaposition to where I am now.

The posts from this point onward will hopefuly be of a higher quality and may dive deeper into technical topics. Or maybe just neovim, I like neovim.
